            <li>Your project must have a log file with an entry for each time a user uploads a CSV account transaction
                file.
            </li>
            <li>There must be a test to verify that the CSV file is uploaded and processed</li>
            <li>You must create a database record that is related to the user record for each transaction</li>
            <li>You must calculate a balance and have a test for this</li>
            <li>You must have a test for login, a test for registration, a test for accessing the dashboard as a
                logged-in
                user, and a test for denying access to the dashboard, and denying access to uploading the CSV file
            </li>
            <li>You will need to have your app work with a dev, prod, and testing configuration file to control the
