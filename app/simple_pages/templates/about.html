    <h1>About</h1>
    <div>
    <p>
        This is my project 3 for the Web Systems Development course. In this project users are able to log
        in and upload a CSV of their playlist and have it displayed on the dashboard.
    </p>
    <h4>Requirements:</h4>
      <ol type = "1">
         <li>Your project must have a log file with an entry for each time a user uploads a CSV playlist. </li>
         <li>There must be a test to verify that the CSV file is uploaded and processed</li>
         <li>You must create a database record that is related to the user record for each song in the playlist.
             You only need to store the song's title, artist, year, and genre. </li>
         <li>You must have a test for login, a test for registration, a test for accessing the dashboard as a logged-in
             user, and a test for denying access to the dashboard, and denying access to uploading the CSV file</li>
         <li>Write a log message for each request and response that records the method, route, time, request address.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>
