            For project 4 you must use the following repository to create a program that allows a user to
            register, login, and upload the CSV file included with the project repository. The user dashboard must
            display
            a table of transactions, and it must display the current balance of the account based on the transactions.
            The starting balance of the account is 0 and is determined by adding and subtracting debits and credits to
            the
            account that are identified as such in the CSV file.
        </p>
